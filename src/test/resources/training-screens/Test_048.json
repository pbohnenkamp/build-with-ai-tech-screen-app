  "jobDescription": "Summary: \n\nAs a full-stack engineer, you’ll be working on the Platform Engineering Team, building a modern application platform to host our company's growing suite of micro apps. You’ll code in NodeJS/TypeScript daily, alongside modern tech, such as AWS, NGINX, Lua, and a robust CI/CD pipeline. Your day-to-day will be back-end development, although we may touch react from time-to-time. \n\nOur clients are your fellow engineers, building microapps, dashboards and UI to service internal/external clients and other employees of the organization.  Help us build the gateways, identity, and data microservices that hundreds of these apps depend upon.  \n\nYou’ll solve complex problems, collaborating with both architects and designers to deliver the platform.  \n\n \n\nThose Buzz Words: \n\nFull Stack, NodeJS, Typescript, Proxies, AWS Cloud infrastructure, NGINX, Lua, NodeJS/TypeScript, React, CI/CD pipeline, Agile, Terraform, Azure, Authentication, Authorization, Caching, Encryption, Cloud Services \n\n \n\nWhat We Can’t Live Without: \n\nStrong JavaScript experience building backend NodeJS micro-services. (TypeScript a plus).\nYou’re comfortable building web apps or microservices and deploying them with git & pipelines.\nYou’re open to learning new tech, and new areas of full stack that you’re not familiar with. Maybe that’s React, Kubernetes, AWS, or DevOps in general. We’re willing to teach you, but you should be ready to learn.\nSelf-motivated and driven. A team player that effectively works well with other engineers, product owners, and non-technical roles. Strong communication skills with those same people.\n3+ years of engineering experience.\n \n\nNice To Haves: \n\nAny experience in AWS, such as Dynamo, S3, Elasticache, EC2, IAM, etc. \nExposure to app servers, such as Nginx or Apache (Open Resty & Lua is even better).\nAny familiarity with Computer Networks (DNS, routing, firewalls).\nAny familiarity with OSI stack.\nComfortable with Unit Testing and Integration Testing and Best Practices (such as Jest).\nExperience with Databases and Key/Value stores, such as Redis, MySql, etc.\nAny experience with GraphQL.\nStrong problem-solving skills.\nStrong sense of ownership and the ability to work with a limited set of requirements\n",
